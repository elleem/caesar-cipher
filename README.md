#### Overview

-[] Define an encrypt function that takes in plaintext and a numeric shift (int)

    -[] Be sure to wrap the shift

-[] Define a decrypt function that takes in ciphertext and a numeric shift (int) when the key is provided

-[] Define a crack function that will decode the cipher so that an encrypted message can be read without access to the key

-[] devise a method to determine if the code was broken with minimal human guidance.
